# Parallaxes and Proper Motions

Jupyter notebooks used to create animated GIFs to demonstrate parallaxes and proper motions for Astronomy 2292 (also useful for intro for non-majors classes).

The notebook retrieves data for nearby stars from the Gaia DR3 database using `astroquery`. 

It is based on a larger and more extensive demo notebook developed by Erik Tollerud, but stripped down here to just the parallax and proper 
motions demo, removing some of the informational demos about the contents of DR3 (useful, but not here), and removed the radial velocities demos.

### Requirements
  Python 3.9, `astropy` (tested on v5.1), `astroquery` (v0.4.6), and `matplotlib` (v3.7.1).

See Erik Tollerud's github repository with the original notebook [gist.github.com/eteq](https://gist.github.com/eteq) for the full demo.
